The problem we were facing was that clients didn&rsquo;t know how to get started with the product. Previously, we showed a list of all available consultants and allowed clients to connect with anyone they chose, so the requests were not always a good fit and both sides got frustrated. To solve this problem, we streamlined the whole process by making the help request form front and center for the client. We also gave consultants the ability to specify which topics they were willing to help in. My role in this project was to mock up the initial designs in Photoshop for the help request page that lists the consultants available for a given request, and then to code all of the CSS to pull it off.
