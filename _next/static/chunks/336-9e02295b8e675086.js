Previously, we showed a list of all available consultants and allowed clients to connect with anyone they chose, so the requests were not always a good fit and both sides got frustrated. To solve this problem, we streamlined the whole process by making the help request form front and center for the client. We also gave consultants the ability to specify which topics they were willing to help in.
